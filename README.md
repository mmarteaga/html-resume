# html-resume
A single-page template done purely with HTML and CSS, which can be rendered into PDF through web browsers' print-to-PDF functionality, making a nice, sleek, professsional and ready-to-print resume.

With the Apache License, please feel free to create your own and share.

NOTE: The files resume.html and resume.css are quasi-samples with typical LOREM IPSUM type; the files res.html and res.css are the true files for myself.
